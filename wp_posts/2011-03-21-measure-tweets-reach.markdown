How often have you been looking through your retweet stream on Twitter, seeing all of your users retweeting your tweet and wanted to know what's the potential tweet reach your tweet got? How many impressions your tweet got through all these retweets?
I have been doing this lately again, flipping through the users that retweeted my tweets and counted their followers together to get an rough estimate how many impressions this tweet could have gotten.
Thank god I don't have to to it anymore. I have just added my Twitter account to <a title="tweet traffic" href="http://www.social-campaigns.com">Social Campaigns</a>, a new Twitter and Facebook analysis tool.
Social Campaigns provides you not only with Twitter statistics like retweet count and potential tweet reach, you even get statistics for Facebook (Likes, Comments). Additionally you get the sum of these as <em>total interactions</em>.

Check out the screenshot:
