At the moment I am finishing up the last bits and pieces of my new venture called <a title="Social Campaigns" href="http://www.social-campaigns.com">Social Campaigns</a>. I have been working on it for a couple of months and hope to release it soon officially, of course as a 'Beta' app ;). In the last months it has quite changed a bit of my initial idea.

In the beginning I wanted to give local businesses an easy way to engage in social network activities, but for different reasons things didn't work out as expected so I had to change directions. Not unusual for a startup, heh!. Now Social Campaigns is a platform for analyzing user interactions on updates (posts) across Facebook and Twitter. I'll give you a quick example. Lets say you post a link through the Social Campaigns interfaceÂ on Facebook and Twitter. Now you can go on the details tab of this update and you will get following metrics:
<ul>
	<li>likes count</li>
	<li>comments count</li>
	<li>retweets count</li>
	<li>total interactions (sum of above)</li>
	<li>potential tweet reach</li>
	<li>page views</li>
	<li>unique page views</li>
</ul>
All the metrics in one sweet spot. Social Campaigns is also thinking in campaigns. Lets say you have a winter sale going on for a week, where you have a new offer each day, so you probably want to group all those updates into a campaign called 'Winter Sale'. So you are able to do this (actually creating a campaign is the first thing you do). Now you will be able to get all the metrics above combined for all updates in this campaign.

I think that will give you a quick overview on Social Campaigns, but its better that you check the <a title="Tour" href="http://social-campaigns.com/en/help/intro">Tour</a> with all the screenshots. Let me know if you have any questions.

Btw, all the content is available in german as well. Here the link to the german homepage: <a title="social campaigns in german" href="http://social-campaigns.com/de">Social Campaigns</a> and the tour in german: <a title="Tour in German" href="http://social-campaigns.com/de/help/intro">Social Campaigns Tour</a>
