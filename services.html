                        <h3>Location based services</h3>
                        <p>Using smartphones and modern browsers applications are aware of a users location so that you don't need to display generic information to your customers or
                            employees, but can display the relevant information for the current location.
                         </p>
                        <p>Services like this can help you to be more efficient or drive sales. Even if your data is not yet location aware, we can help you to extend your data so
                            that it will be.</p>

                        <p><em>Only display information a user really needs!</em></p>

                    <div class="span4 service">
                        <h3>Real time solutions</h3>
                        <p>For a lot of businesses it is vital to know exactly how much the failure rate currently is, how many users a product use or where it's
                        drivers are located. Previously this was only possible through expensive systems. New web application servers and the latest browsers have
                        lowered the barriers extensively and such system can be implemented easily.</p>

                        <p>You know what's vital for your business, we can visualize it in Realtime, no matter if it's a number or a graph.</p>

                        <h3>Mapping applications</h3>
                        <p>To optimize a driver's route it often requires to visualize where a driver has been driving. Displaying such a track is one of the scenarios
                        for a mapping application. Other scenarios could be to display a skiing resort with all the ski lifts and ski runs on the map.</p>

                        <p>Whatever you want to visualize on a map, we can help you with it.</p>

                        <h3>Billing solutions</h3>
                        <p>Sometimes existing billing solutions don't fit your needs, or you don't even have a automatic billing system. We worked on different
                        implementations to allow one time or recurring billings.</p>
