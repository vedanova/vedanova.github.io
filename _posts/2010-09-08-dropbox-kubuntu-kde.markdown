Once more I was thinking it would be good to have Dropbox installed on my Notebook, to have a online backup for my important documents. I had a look at UbuntuOne a few weeks back, but couldn't get the KDE implementation to work and forgot about it.
Today I thought lets have a look at Dropbox again, and of course it is a step child on Kubuntu again, but nevertheless an amazing guy did some great work and it couldn't be easier to get it running.

So, if you want to get Dropbox onto KDE don't hesitate and grab the deb package <a href="http://kdropbox.deuteros.es/">here</a>.

Thanks to Guillermo!
