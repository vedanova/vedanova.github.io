One of the big questions always comes up is: How do you want to compete with the big guys?

This is one question I was asked recently from someone, or questions like, what if this guy/Google/Yahoo just takes a couple of programmer and copies your idea in less than a month. A simple answer is, there is nothing you can do about it, just live with it and go on. They might do it, but the chance is rather slim. Especially when looking at Google or Yahoo. When was the last time they really "created" a product. With Google only "Waves" comes to mind, with Yahoo nothing, they mostly buy stuff. Even Android was bought by them, as far I can recall. So nothing really to worry about? There might be others, smaller guys, VC backed companies that copy your idea and market the hell out of it.
The only thing you can do about it, is probably staying out of sight until you have a decent product and / or just don't worry too much about it, or get yourself VC funded, what I personally want to avoid. At least for now, as long as our server/storage costs don't kill us.
<h3>So what if you get copied?</h3>
There might be a chance, that you haven't been copied, with all that gazillions people out there, there is probably someone with a similar idea working on it right now. Just keep an eye on them, if you know about them, but stay focused on your idea. Don't try to copy their ideas, maybe you will get some inspiration, but there is the huge possibility that the market is big enough for both "similar" ideas. Some people might like yours better, some don't. Thats ok. You don't have to be liked by everyone. Just go ahead and try to fit your product to market. It might take longer, but its hard to be the next Dropbox, Foursquare or whatever you just heard about. They all developed for some years to get the right thing out, so try by yourself.
