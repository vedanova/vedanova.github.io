I have been struggling now a bit to find the HAML plugin for Netbeans. All the links I found point to the 'sunmediacast.com' website that doesn't exist anymore, after Oracle took over Sun.

After a bit more googling I found a project on code.google.com where I could download a plugin version. Not sure if it is the latest but it seems to work in Netbeans 6.9.1.

Download it <a title="Haml Plugin" href="http://code.google.com/p/postcomment/downloads/detail?name=org-netbeans-modules-haml.nbm&amp;can=2&amp;q=" target="_blank">here</a>.
