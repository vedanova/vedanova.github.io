I don't know about you, but I don't trust these domain scalpers displaying my ads and telling me someone clicked on it. I do not trust Google either and I do not want to have any of my ad $$ going to anyone of these. They are annoying anyways, as they block all decent domains.

Here is a quick guide how you can prevent your ads showing up on these sites.

First log into your Adwords account.
Next click on '<strong>Reporting and Tools</strong>' tab.
On the bottom of the drop down you find '<strong>more tools</strong>' - perfectly hidden. Google wants the $$.
Next click on <strong>Site and Category Exclusion</strong>
Now you are nearly there
Click on the tab '<strong>Page Types</strong>'
Now you can choose '<strong>Parked Domains'</strong> I do exclude error pages as well.

Hope this helps and I hope Google would stop serving ads to them.!!
