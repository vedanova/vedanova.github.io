I have a news reader application out for Android called <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.vedanova.OesterreichReader&amp;feature=search_result">Austria Reader</a> that has now more than 2000 active installs, which is not too bad for being out for about 3 months I think. Today Google introduced statistics for each application, so I thought I share these with you. A news reader app should be quite representational.
<h2>OS versions</h2>

So, for all developers, I think we can just ignore all versions below 2.1, its less than 0.2 percent.
<h2>Devices</h2>
For the devices I am quite surprised that the Samsung Galaxy Tab is on 2nd place, past the Galaxy S. <strong>Galaxy S</strong> has a 31.5% lead to the uprunner HTC Desire. I was sure the Galaxy will be on top, but such a lead is quite surprising.

The manufacturers comparison:
<ul>
	<li>Samsung: 59.3%</li>
	<li>HTC: 24.3%</li>
	<li>Motorola: 2.3%</li>
	<li>SE: 4%</li>
</ul>
Will be interesting how this is gonna change over the next couple of months.

If you can share statistics, let me know and link to it in the comments.
